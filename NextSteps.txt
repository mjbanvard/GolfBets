1. Use a Raspberry Pi to create a Docker container that spins up 
    a SQL database and seeds it with some data
2. Connect app to the database and have it build the scorecard
3. Enable hole scores to be edited and saved back to database

Currently working on being able to change the scores in the scorecard.  
Will likely need to make a new class.
